# Color2Gray
This is an implementation of the color2gray algorithm [(Gooch et al., 2005)](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ago820/color2gray/) developed in November 2018 as the final project for the class of Fundamentals of Image Processing, from the course of Computer Science at [UFRGS](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en/), Brazil. Here's our [illustrated report](http://inf.ufrgs.br/~awcampana/docs/color2gray.pdf) (in Portuguese) with pictures of the results we achieved. 

This implementation has a Command-Line Interface; there's a GUI version uploaded to [Júlia's GitHub account](https://github.com/juviolato/color2gray).

### Compile
This program depends on the OpenCV library (```opencv2``` package). To compile this program, simply execute the command ```$make``` to call Makefile.
